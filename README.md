# PWC-PowerBI-Internship

In these virtual internship I had the opportunity to work on three projects utilizing Power BI and SQL, which provided me with invaluable insights and hands-on experience.

**Project 1: Sales Insight Analysis**

In this project, I focused on analyzing sales data to gain valuable insights for the organization. Using Power BI and SQL, I collected and processed relevant data related to sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends. Through visualizations and interactive dashboards, I was able to identify patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences. This project helped me understand the importance of data-driven decision making in optimizing sales strategies and identifying potential growth opportunities.

**Project 2: HR Diversity and Inclusion**

Diversity and inclusion are crucial aspects of any organization. In this project, I used Power BI and SQL to analyze HR data and gain insights into diversity and inclusion within the company. By examining employee demographics, performance metrics, and feedback data, I was able to identify areas where the organization excelled and areas that required improvement. This project highlighted the significance of fostering an inclusive workplace environment and provided me with a deeper understanding of HR analytics.

**Project 3: Call Center Analysis**

Call centers play a vital role in customer service and satisfaction. In this project, I utilized Power BI and SQL to analyze call center data, including call duration, customer feedback, and service quality metrics. By visualizing this data, I was able to identify potential bottlenecks, customer pain points, and areas of improvement. This project allowed me to grasp the importance of efficient call center operations and customer-centric approaches.
